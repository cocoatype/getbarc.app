If you downloaded Barc for the first time prior to the release of Barc 24.5, you need to do a one-time reset of the state of the app in order for sync with Apple Watch to work.

Your iPhone/iPad state must be reset before your Apple Watch state, in order to sync the barcodes you have on there, so that the Apple Watch can receive them.

The instructions that follow are the “fastest” way to do this, but either set of instructions can be replaced by fully rebooting your devices instead. Either way, please be sure to first launch the iPhone app, **then** the Apple Watch app.

## Resetting your iPhone/iPad

1. Open the device’s App Switcher:
   - If your device has a Home button, double-click it.
   - If your device does not have a Home button, swipe up from the bottom edge, and pause in the center of the screen.
1. Swipe to find Barc in the set of apps.
2. Swipe up to force-quit Barc.
3. Re-open Barc from the Home Screen, App Library, or Spotlight.

## Resetting your Apple Watch

1. Launch the Barc app.
2. Press and hold the side button (the flat button) until the power screen appears.
   - This screen also contains sliders for Medical ID and Emergency Call on some Apple Watch models.
1. Release the side button and press and hold the Digital Crown until the watch face appears.
2. Re-open Barc.
