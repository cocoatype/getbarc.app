The new year brings familiar promises: eat better, exercise more, and finally get organized. While Barc can't help with your diet (I recommend [Foodnoms](https://www.foodnoms.com/) for that), it can make "get organized" an achievable resolution. I built Barc to help you tackle both physical and digital clutter by wrangling your growing collection of cards, tickets, and passes into one streamlined system.

## Eliminating Physical Cards

Your wallet shouldn't look like it's about to burst. Those stacks of loyalty cards, gym memberships, and library cards not only create physical bulk – they're also easy to lose or forget when you need them most. Here's how you get started: just [open the camera](barc:///scanner) right from Barc to scan any barcode or QR code. Give them helpful labels like "Gym" or "Coffee Shop", and add locations to find your cards quickly. Once they're safely in Barc, you can keep your physical cards stored at home instead of keeping them with you all the time.

## Eliminating Digital "Card" Apps

Digital clutter can be just as frustrating as physical clutter. Think about how many apps are sitting on your phone just because you need it to scan a code. Each one takes up storage space, needs updates, and adds another icon to scroll past. Here's where Barc comes in. You can import your existing passes and cards right from screenshots, consolidating multiple single-store apps into one organized space. You can finally clean up your app library by deleting unnecessary apps and save your phone storage and update bandwidth.

## Eliminating… Barc?

Yeah, this is all pretty ironic – an app promising to reduce clutter is just another thing to manage. That's why I've designed Barc to integrate seamlessly into your daily routine, so ideally you never have to launch it once you've added your cards. Put your most-used passes right on your home screen with widgets, and they'll always be just a tap away. When you're out and about, Barc's library can show you the right passes based on where you are - perfect for when you arrive at the gym or your favorite coffee shop. And for the ultimate convenience, you can check your passes right from your Apple Watch, even if you don't have your phone with you.

The best organization systems are the ones you barely notice using. By thoughtfully digitizing your physical cards and consolidating your digital ones, Barc helps you start the new year with less to carry and less to manage. Take a few minutes now to grab your wallet, add some cards to Barc, and scratch one of your resolutions off your list early.
