## Introduction

Barc is an iPhone app that helps you save and organize all your important barcodes in one place. From store loyalty cards to gym memberships to movie tickets, Barc makes sure you always have the right barcode when you need it.

What sets Barc apart is its seamless integration with iOS. Rather than requiring you to open the app every time, Barc makes your barcodes available through widgets, Apple Watch, Siri, and custom Shortcuts. It can even suggest relevant barcodes based on your location, ensuring quick access exactly when you need them.

## Key Benefits

### Intelligent Organization
Barc automatically surfaces relevant barcodes based on location and time, so you always have quick access to the ones you need right now.

### System-wide Access
Access your barcodes from anywhere in iOS. Whether that's through widgets, Apple Watch, Siri, or the Action Button. Once your barcodes are in Barc, you may never need to open the app again.

### Effortless Import
Add barcodes in whatever way works best for you &mdash; scan physical cards, import from screenshots, or share directly from other apps. Barc handles most common barcode formats automatically.
