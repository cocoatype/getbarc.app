At Cocoatype, we respect the privacy of users, and don&apos;t share data with anyone you don&apos;t know. For that matter, we prefer to avoid even collecting that data in the first place. Barc shares as little information as possible to do its job.

## Website Logging

If you visit the Barc website (this website!) using a web browser, either a standalone browser or the one included inside the Barc app, some metadata about that visit is logged temporarily. This may include: your IP address, some information about the browser making the request (such as OS, browser version, etc.), and the time and date of the request.

I basically never look at these logs, but they’re useful for diagnosing issues, and can be used to watch for trends such as where new users are being referred from. These logs are deleted automatically after two weeks.

## App Logging

Some actions and errors in the app are logged, anonymously and in bulk, with a service called TelemetryDeck. This data includes your device model, current OS version, and current version of Barc. This information is used to identify issues with the app experience. It does **not** include any personal data or your stored information, and cannot be used to identify any individual user. TelemetryDeck&apos;s service is built with privacy in mind. [TelemetryDeck&apos;s privacy policy](https://telemetrydeck.com/privacy/) details how they handle your data.

## Customer Support

If you [e-mail me](mailto:hello@cocoatype.com), I have the contents of that e-mail and the address that it came from. I generally keep these e-mails forever because it helps identify problems that multiple customers have had, and so I can send updates if your issue is addressed. If you’d rather I not keep your e-mails, just let me know, and they’ll be deleted when our conversation is finished.

## Apple
Apple may (depending on your preferences) collect some analytics about your use of Black Highlighter and send them (anonymized, in bulk) to me for identifying crashes, general usage trends, etc. [Apple’s privacy policy](https://apple.com/privacy) details how Apple handles your data.

## Other Information

This privacy policy might change over time. A [full change history](https://github.com/cocoatype/getbarc.app/blob/deploy/content/privacy.md) is available.

If you have any questions about anything on this page, or have some other concern, [send me an e-mail](mailto:hello@cocoatype.com).
