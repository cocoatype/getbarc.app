## Barc 24.2 — Est. September 26th, 2024
### Increased barcode support
Barc will add support for the Codabar, Code 39, and Code 128 barcode types, which covers the vast majority of reported barcode issues.

### Fix "Unexpected error" message
When trying to add barcodes using the share sheet that use an unsupported format, Barc will display an error explaining the situation instead of a generic "unexpected error" message.

### Improve Apple Watch syncing
Several people have reported that getting barcodes synced to the Apple Watch app isn't working for them. This release will improve and speed up the syncing between your phone and your watch.

### Barcode view brightness
Barc will increase the brightness of the screen when viewing single barcodes, to make them easier to scan.

### Improve empty-library state
The barcode library page will display helpful text and action buttons when there are no barcodes saved, to make it clearer how to get started.

### Prevent unnamed barcodes
Barcodes with no names are the cause of some subtle bugs. This update will prevent them from existing in the first place, and add a name to any that exist already.

## Barc 24.3 — Est. October 10th, 2024
### Increased barcode support
Barc will add support for the PDF417 barcode type, used at some retail locations such as Starbucks.

### Apple Wallet export
Barc will allow you to export barcodes to the Apple Wallet app.

## Barc 24.4

### Import photos from library
Barc will let you add barcodes directly from your photo library, instead of sharing them from the Photos app.

### Increased Shortcuts support
Barc will include more Shortcuts actions, including creating barcodes, scanning images, listing codes, and setting locations/dates.
