## Barc 24.2 — Est. September 26th, 2024
### Increased barcode support
Add support for the Codabar, Code 39, and Code 128 barcode types, which covers the vast majority of reported barcode issues.

### Barcode view brightness
Increase the brightness of the screen when viewing single barcodes, to make it easier to scan.

### Improve empty-library state
Add helpful text and action buttons to make the barcode library more usable when there are no barcodes saved.

### Increased barcode support
Add support for the PDF417 barcode type, used at some retail locations such as Starbucks.
