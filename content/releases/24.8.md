Barc 24.8 adds support for PDF417 barcodes, used by many store loyalty programs and U.S. state driver&apos;s licenses.

This release also fixes a bug with Shortcuts, where some "programmer-ese" was shown instead of proper text.

Barc's help menu now also links to two new ways to contact the developer: via Bluesky and Facebook! If you have any questions, comments, or feature requests, please reach out via any of the methods provided.
