Barc 25.1 adds some new features for Apple Watch users.

### Watch Face Complications

Place your most-used barcodes on your watch face for quick access.

### Wrist Rotation

You can twist your wrist to show a barcode to someone else or to a scanner facing you. The watch stays on and automatically flips the code over.

### Bug Fixes

- Editing a barcode&apos;s name, location, or date is immediately reflected in the library instead of requiring an app relaunch.
- The dark mode icon added in Barc 25.0 uses the system gradient background instead of a flat black background.
