This release of Barc includes the following updates:

### Increased barcode support
Barc now has support for for the Codabar, Code 39, and Code 128 barcode types, which covers the vast majority of reported barcode issues.

### Fix “Unexpected error” message
When trying to add barcodes using the share sheet that use an unsupported format, Barc will now display an error explaining the situation instead of a generic “unexpected error” message.

### Improve Apple Watch syncing
Several people have reported that getting barcodes synced to the Apple Watch app wasn’t working for them. This update will improve and speed up the syncing between your phone and your watch.

### Barcode view brightness
Barc will now increase the brightness of the screen when viewing single barcodes, to make them easier to scan.

### Prevent unnamed barcodes
Barcodes with no names were the cause of some subtle bugs. This update will prevent them from existing in the first place, and add a name to any that exist already.
