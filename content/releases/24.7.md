Barc 24.7 polishes up some of the changes introduced in Barc 24.6.

Barc 24.6 introduced a bug with the home screen widget that causes it to draw barcodes shortened and off-center. Barc 24.7 restores the full-width display of barcodes.

Barc 24.6 introduced a bunch of new actions in Shortcuts, but if something went wrong, it wasn't always easy to figure out what happened. Barc 24.7 improves the error messages that are displayed if your Shortcut fails to run.
