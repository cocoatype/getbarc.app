Barc 24.6 adds a bunch of new ways to quickly find a specific code when you need it.

### Automatic Siri Integration

You can ask Siri to open any barcode in Barc as soon as it's added; no additional setup required. Say "Open (your barcode name) in Barc" to show that barcode's page in Barc.

### Search Bar

A search bar at the top of the barcodes list helps you filter the list to find just the barcode you need.

### Spotlight Integration

Search for your barcodes in Spotlight to open them in Barc.

### New Shortcuts Actions

Several new actions were added to Shortcuts to help you build your own workflows:

- Create a new barcode with a given value.
- Create a barcode by scanning a photo or screenshot.
- Get the value of a barcode.
- Get the list of all your barcodes.
- Add a relevant location or date to a barcode.
