Barc 25.0 makes using Barc for the first time (or first time in a while) much simpler.

### Empty Library Additions

When you have no barcodes stored, Barc gives you more information about how to get started. No more staring at an empty screen wondering what to do next.

### Introduction Tour Progress

In the introduction tour, Barc now shows how many pages you have left, and you can now travel backward and forward throughout the tour as you like.

### What's New Badge

When new versions of Barc come out, a small badge will show up to help you learn about the latest features.

### New Dark Mode Icon

Barc's app icon now looks much nicer when using the dark or tinted app icons on your home screen.

### Shortcuts Fix

The Shortcuts app now shows each of your barcodes only once in the app list, rather than duplicated across two sections.
