Version 24.3 of Barc is just squashing a few more launch bugs:

- Fixed a common crash on iPhone that happened when checking your location for relevant barcodes.
- Fixed a crash that could occur immediately after opening the app on Apple Watch.
- Added additional fixes around an issue that could cause the app to act like you hadn't purchased or started a trial of Barc Unleashed when using the share sheet import.
