## Open Source Libraries

Barc uses several open-source libraries to power various parts of the app. The libraries in use are listed below, and link to their various licenses. Barc&apos;s developer, [Cocoatype](https://cocoatype.com), thanks the creators of these libraries for their contributions to the Swift community.

### Introspect

Barc uses the [Introspect for SwiftUI library](https://github.com/siteline/SwiftUI-Introspect) to build some user interface elements, such as the single-barcode view. Introspect is licensed under the [MIT license](introspect).

### RevenueCat

Barc uses [RevenueCat's Purchases SDK](https://github.com/RevenueCat/purchases-ios-spm/) to power the subscriptions for Barc Unleashed, along with its paywall. The SDK is licensed under the [MIT license](revenuecat).

### Swift QR Code Generator

Barc uses the [Swift QR Code Generator](https://github.com/fwcd/swift-qrcode-generator) to generate the data needed to render QR codes. The library is licensed under the [MIT license](swift-qrcode-generator).

### TelemetryDeck

Barc uses the [TelemetryDeck SDK](https://github.com/TelemetryDeck/SwiftSDK) to send privacy-preserving data to the TelemetryDeck service for analytics and error-tracking purposes. The SDK is licensed under the [MIT license](telemetrydeck).

## Inspirations

In addition to the open-source libraries that are used directly in Barc, Cocoatype wishes to thank the creators of several apps who inspired features or interface designs in Barc.

### Craft
[Craft](https://www.craft.do) by Craft Docs Limited, Inc. inspired the "masonry" layout of barcodes on the main barcode library page. 

### Fantastical
[Fantastical](https://flexibits.com/fantastical) by Flexibits Inc. inspired the design of the location picker and the way dates and times are edited.

### Foodnoms
[Foodnoms](https://www.foodnoms.com) by Algebraic Labs, LLC inspired the design of the single-barcode page and the display of dates and locations on the library page.

### Grocery
[Grocery](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/grocery-smart-shopping-list/id1195676848) by Conrad Stoll inspired the layout of the toolbar on the library page for adding new barcodes, as well as the concept of location-based triggers for barcodes.
